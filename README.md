# Overview

Boxstax is a user-interactive game where players stack boxes as straight as possible to achieve the highest height / score. 

## Features: 
  * Click to drop moving box
  * Score counter increasing after successful box drop
  * Slowly increase speeds after each consecutive box drop
  * If box stacked does not match exactly to the dimensions of the one below, it cuts the width of your future blocks 
  * Game is over if box is not stacked on top of the previous box 

Boxstax will utilize js, canvas, css, and html to create this frontend game.
